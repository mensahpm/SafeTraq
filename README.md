As a safety manager, one of the most routine work products I created were jobsite photo sheets. Giving management a visual picture of site operations was key to tracking improvements. This prototype web app will help safety professionals efficiently organize photos and notes- saving time and resources. I built the front-end with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and am currently weighing options for the backend database.
